# PowerBI Projects

This repository contains two PowerBI-based projects that analyze data from different domains. The projects include the following:

## 1. HR Analytics Project

This project provides insights into various HR metrics, aimed at understanding employee retention, performance, and workforce demographics. The project uses PowerBI to visualize and analyze HR-related data.

### Key Files:
- `HR_Analytics.csv`: Contains the raw data used for the analysis.
- `HR_Analytics.pbix`: PowerBI file with the interactive dashboard and visualizations.
- `HR_Analytics.pdf`: Report summarizing the analysis and insights from the data.
- `background-bluee.jpg`, `Background.jpg`: Background images used in the PowerBI reports.

This project explores various HR performance indicators and helps businesses make informed decisions about employee management, retention strategies, and workforce planning.

## 2. University Enrollment and Graduation Trends Project

This project analyzes enrollment and graduation trends across different cohorts of students in a university setting. It leverages PowerBI to visualize historical data, uncovering patterns in enrollment and graduation rates over time.

### Key Files:
- `Most-Recent-Cohorts-Cleaned.csv`: The cleaned dataset used in the analysis.
- `University_Analysis.pbix`: PowerBI file containing the analysis and visualizations.
- `Project Report.docx`, `Project Report.pdf`: Detailed report summarizing the trends and conclusions derived from the dataset.
- `cleaning.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook used for data cleaning and preprocessing before analysis.
- `Background.jpg`: Background image used in the PowerBI reports.

This project provides insights into university enrollment and graduation trends, enabling educational institutions to assess their strategies and improve student retention.
